# About frontend

This is the frontend of our CV application, and is based on [React Create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). 

## Start the application
 - Install all packages with `npm i ` (inside this folder)
 - Run the application with `npm start`

The application is connected to the backend through *proxy* inside *package.json*.

#### Local
To run the application with the local backend, use `localhost:3000` (TODO: Insert exact backend url).

#### Cloud
Inside *proxy* inside *package.json*, swap the address to `http://[your IP-address]`.



## About the frontend: 
Our frontend is made of:
 - [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
 - [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)
 - [React bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components.html#page-layout): used for simple styling
